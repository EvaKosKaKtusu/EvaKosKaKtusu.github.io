    <h2>Why did I make this website</h2>
    <p>I made this website for the love for cats and because my goal is to give people correct information about their sofa master. I always loved cats and I read lots of books about them since I was a child. Now I want to share all I know about cats with the world and hope that it will come useful.</p>
